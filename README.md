# DTSA_5503_HW
Programming Assignments for DTSA 5503: Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms. All homeworks done in python 3.9. General structure is sections of code and tests on said code divided by lines of comment symbols.

HW 1 problem four requires a csv that was pre-loaded into the virtual environment, and so won't run correctly outside of said environment. I'll email the professor to try and get a copy which will be uploaded to this repo in the event I receive it. 

HW 2:
The first question asked us to devise a program that found the longest stable subsequence of a given sequence A = [a0, a2, ..., an-1] such that:
1) elements were chosen strictly left to right from A
2) sequential elements chosen must be within one digit of each other.
3) the length of the returned subsequence was maximized

Problem two required me to find a subset T from a given set of natural numbers S = {a0, ..., an} and a target natural number N which obeyed the following properties:
1) The sum of elements in T must be less than or equal to N
2) The difference between N and the sum of elements in T must be minimized
