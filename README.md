# DTSA_5503_HW
Programming Assignments for DTSA 5503: Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms. All homeworks done in python 3.9. General structure is sections of code and tests on said code divided by lines of comment symbols.

HW 1 problem four requires a csv that was pre-loaded into the virtual environment, and so won't run correctly outside of said environment. I'll email the professor to try and get a copy which will be uploaded to this repo in the event I receive it.
